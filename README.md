# mini-front-end-edmodo
If cloned or downloaded, please run a simple server after moving into the app folder.
I would sugguest using the below commands if not familiar with running a simple server for the delivery of front end assets.
```
$ cd app/
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

###Notes about project
- Assets are not optimized for production. Files are minified.
- If backend fails, current iteration of project does not have warning to a frontend user.
- Also, code and UI is not tested with Karama, JUnit, Jasmine, or Selenium.  A full iteration would include such tests.
